# kaggle_comp_melting_temp
This competition is to predict the melting temperature of various compounds give their SMILE format chemical structure and a descriptor space referred to by group numbers.  I first tested converting the SMILES into 3D molecular structures, and from that to 3D pixel grids.  I then used 3D CNN model to predict melting temperature.  With multiple optimization efforts including normalizing the labels, batch normalization, dropout, number of epochs, cross fold validation, adding in rotated versions of the 3D grids, and adding in multiple chemical conformations, the best MAE I was able to achieve was around 42 degrees C.  Switching to an XGBRegressor type model I was able to drop MAE to around 33 C. I did hyperparameter tuning with RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV but this did not end up finding parameters with better performance than MAE of 33 C. I submitted predictions for the XGBRegressor model and got a score of 33.2 and a ranking of 469 out of 670 entries as of 11/26/2025.  In the future, I think this model will require some additional feature engineering in order to be improved.  My idea would be to convert the SMILE data to something that can be interpreted by ASE atoms library, so that the matminer featurizers can be used.
